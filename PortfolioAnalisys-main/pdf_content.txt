Don’t get Trapped in a Pitfall! 
Modern Portfolio Theory and its Discontents
I
n this note, we argue that classic risk measures (such as volatility) do not consider the path 
followed by returns and leave out the risk of potential large drawdowns. We also show that 
using path dependent measures such as the Ulcer Index or Conditional Drawdown at Risk adds 
valuable information to any investment decision. We propose a new measure of the global risk: 
The Serenity Ratio which reveals both the average and extreme risk carried by an investment. 
We conclude that this indicator can be used in a modified version of the Modern Portfolio Theory 
[Markowitz (1952)] and help investors choose the best strategies for their portfolio.
The Flaws of Classic Risk Measures
Annualized standard deviation or volatility (Sharpe Ratio being its return adjusted version) 
is one of the most widely used measures of the riskiness of an investment. However, this 
measure presents some drawbacks of which investors may not be aware. Both upside and 
downside changes in prices are used to calculate the volatility of an investment.
Many investors therefore use a modified version of standard deviation that only penalizes 
the downside risk: Downside Volatility (Sortino Ratio [Rom (1983)] being its return adjusted 
version). This downside risk measure can be misleading1 when it comes to fat tail distributions.
The Omega Ratio [Shadwick and Keating (2002b)] was developed to overcome these non-
normal limitations by taking into account all moments of the distribution function. 
However, all these measures do not consider autocorrelation of returns (i.e., today’s return is 
dependent on yesterday’s return). 
Consider the three following strategies
2, 3:
• An investment in the MSCI World Index (“Long” Strategy)
• An investment in an asset where we rearranged the returns of the MSCI World Index so 
that the worst months occur first, ahead of the best months (“Sorted” Strategy)
• An investment in an asset where we rearranged the returns of the MSCI World Index in 
order to minimize drawdowns (“Flattened” Strategy)
1 The measure does not focus on tail loss and therefore may significantly understate the range of potential losses.
2 The ideas presented in this paper are adapted from Martin (1987). 
3 In this article, we always subtract the risk free rate (LIBOR) from our noted strategies. Thus, not achieving 
this minimum return represents a loss or a drawdown.

 Figure 1 (below) displays the net asset value of these three investment strategies:
 
Figure 1: NAVs of the “Long”, “Sorted” and “Flattened” Strategies from 2000 to 2016 (Source: Bloomberg)
These three strategies offer identical annualized return, volatility, downside-volatility, Omega 
ratio, and even the same VaR and CVaR figures. Thus, without seeing the NAV chart and only 
viewing the classic risk-return metrics, an investor would be indifferent: all three strategies 
would look equally good. An investor would be at risk of choosing the Sorted Strategy which 
exhibits much bigger drawdowns than the Flattened or Long Strategy (hidden risk).
The Sharpe Ratio, although a good measure of adjusted performance, clearly should not be 
the sole investment criterion. T o obtain a more accurate and actionable view of the true global 
risk of an investment, investors need to consider the risk of long and/or acute drawdowns.
Maximum drawdown is a measure of the maximum decline of the NAV from its historical peak 
(Calmar Ratio being its return-adjusted version). Although it is a path dependent metric, maximum 
drawdown is not representative of the global risk of an investment because it only focuses on 
the worst observed drawdown and not on the length and recurrence of each drawdown.
The section that follows presents a risk measure developed by Martin (1987) to take drawdown 
risk into consideration.

Ulcer Index (UI): Consider Drawdowns
The Ulcer Index (“UI,” or “Ulcer”) measures both the depth and duration of drawdowns and 
is one of the rare risk indicators that is path-dependent. Its return-adjusted version is a better 
indicator than the Sharpe Ratio for investors who are more concerned by drawdowns (vs. 
volatility). The name of the index comes from the supposition that drawdowns cause stress 
and ulcers to investors. 
Ulcer is calculated by taking the quadratic mean4 of the drawdowns5:
                                                                                              ,
where                                      is the drawdown at date t.
The reader can note a similarity with the definition of standard deviation 
(where the deviation of returns is replaced by the drawdowns):
                                                                                               ,
Therefore, Ulcer only takes into account the “downside” risk of a strategy (drawdown equals 
0 when the price is at its maximum value).
 Flattened Strategy Long Strategy Sorted Strategy
 Annualized Return 1.75% 1.75% 1.75%
 Annualized Volatility 15.5% 15.5% 15.5%
 Ulcer Index 3.7% 24.4% 86.4%
T able 1: Annualized returns, volatility and UI of the three strategies (Source: Bloomberg)
Indeed, for the same returns and volatilities, the Ulcer of the Flattened Strategy is nearly seven 
times smaller than the Ulcer of the Long Strategy and twenty-three times smaller than the 
Ulcer of the Sorted Strategy. Were an investor to consider Ulcer as their principal risk measure, 
they would have a persuasive reason for choosing the Flattened Strategy. 
4 This measure is a convex risk metric as shown in Chekhlov et al. (2005) and annex 1.
5 A simplified Ulcer Index (sometimes called the Pain Index) can be defined by taking the arithmetic mean.

Martin (1987) also defines the Ulcer Performance Index (UPI) which is the return divided by 
Ulcer. UPI is the Ulcer counterpart of the Sharpe Ratio. 
Just like volatility, Ulcer represents an average risk and does not take into consideration tail risk. T o 
create a global measure of risk, the next part of this paper will study the tail events of drawdowns. 
T o summarize our argument thus far:
Average Risk = Ulcer Index
Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR)
As shown in the previous section, Martin was able to define a risk measure (UPI) somewhat 
comparable to a Sharpe Ratio by changing the data of reference in the calculation from returns 
to drawdowns. In a similar fashion, Chekhlov et al. (2005)6 define DaR and CDaR for Drawdown 
at Risk and Conditional Drawdown at Risk, comparable to the VaR and CVaR definition.
We define DaR and CDaR as the VaR and CVaR of the Drawdowns distribution (and not the 
return distribution). Therefore, DaR(α) represents the 1-α% biggest drawdowns and CDaR(α) 
is the mean of the drawdowns strictly under the DaR(α).
The DaR(95%) and CDaR(95%) of the S&P 500 can be observed in Figure 2:

7 This oxymoron has been made on purpose.
 Figure 3 shows the visual interpretation of the CDaR(95%) on the underwater 
 curve of the S&P 500.
 
Figure 3: CDaR(95%) for the SP500 from Jan. 1990 to Mar. 2016 (Source: Bloomberg)
The CDaR corresponds to the average of the drawdowns falling under the black line which 
is the DaR(95%) = 43.3%. In this example, CDaR(95%) = 48.2%.
We assume that an investor’s level of pain varies on each drawdown. The sharper and/or the 
longer the drawdown, the higher the discomfort. The most important factor is what investors 
are ready to stomach based on the risk they believe they are taking. When investing in a 
strategy with 1% vs. 10% volatility, one does not expect the same drawdown. For this reason, 
we measure CDaR in multiples of volatility to create a new risk metric: The Pitfall Indicator.
Pitfall Indicator (PI): Measuring the Surprises
In the following paragraph, we create an indicator to measure the bad surprises an investor 
can expect
7. An investor is sort of “trapped” inside a drawdown, and can be surprised by an 
abnormal depth, hence the name: Pitfall Indicator (“PI” or “Pitfall”).
The Pitfall Indicator is defined as:
0%
-10%
-20%
-30%
-40%
-50%
-60%

The Pitfall represents the average loss of the biggest drawdowns expressed in units of volatility. 
Thus, the bigger the number, the riskier is the strategy. The Pitfall also addresses one of the 
main flaws of Ulcer explained below. Let us consider the following two stereotyped strategies:
 
Figure 4: Net Asset Value of 2 stereotyped strategies (log-scale)
 Steady Strategy Unpredictable Strategy
Annualized Return 7.5% 7.5%
Volatility 6.0% 6.0%
Ulcer Index 7.0% 7.0%
CDaR(95%) 10% 40%
 Pitfall Indicator 1.64 6.31
T able 2: Statistics of the 2 stereotyped strategies
Both strategies offer the same returns, volatility, and Ulcer, but it is clear that they do 
not offer the same drawdown profiles. The Steady Strategy exhibits frequent but small 
drawdowns resulting in a Pitfall of 1.64 (times the volatility of the strategy). The Steady 
Strategy presents a low risk of surprises to an investor.

On the other hand, the Unpredictable Strategy exhibits infrequent but deep drawdowns 
resulting in a Pitfall of 6.31 (times its volatility). The Unpredictable Strategy causes a big 
problem as no rational investor would expect a drawdown over 40% at this level of volatility 
(6%). This unexpected sharp drawdown will most likely result in the investor cutting his losses 
and not waiting for a potential recovery.
The Pitfall indicator reflects the number of volatility an investor risks losing by being trapped 
in a drawdown and should not be ignored in the context of portfolio construction. Considering 
the following two assets:
• A strategy with a volatility of 5% and a CDaR of 10% (Pitfall=2)
• A strategy with a volatility of 20% and a CDaR of 20% (Pitfall=1)
An investor using the classic risk parity (1/Vol) methodology would allocate 4 times more 
money to the first strategy. In doing so, the investor greatly increases the risk of a blow-up 
since the strategy is more likely to reach a deeper drawdown vis-à-vis the volatility (as reflected 
in the value of the Pitfall).
A strategy can exhibit low average risk (that is, low Ulcer Index or volatility), yet suffer rare 
extreme drawdowns. It makes sense to penalize such strategies as their average risk does 
not represent the actual risk. Therefore, we argue that:
Extreme Risk Penalty = Pitfall Indicator =    CDaR
        Vol
An Alternative Portfolio Theory
16  |
The Serenity Ratio (SR)
In this section, we create the Serenity Ratio, a Sharpe Ratio equivalent using a penalized risk 
measure instead of volatility.
First, we use the Pitfall to penalize our previously defined measure of average risk: 
Penalized Risk = Average Risk x Extreme Risk Penalty
Penalized Risk = Ulcer x Pitfall   
This measure of Penalized Risk represents the average risk of a strategy (Ulcer) adjusted by 
a measure of extreme risk (Pitfall). Thus, the new measure of risk considers all three-metrics 
defined previously in this paper: Volatility, Ulcer and CDaR.
By definition:
• The lower the Ulcer the lower the risk of drawdowns
• The lower the Pitfall the lower the risk of surprises
Therefore, just like volatility, the lower the Penalized Risk, the less risky the strategy.
Serenity Ratio (“SR,” or “Serenity”), is defined as Return divided by Penalized Risk: 
 
      
     
The name is derived from the fact that the higher the value of Serenity, the more serene an 
investor will feel in regards to his investment decision. The Serenity is comparable to the 
Sharpe Ratio, the higher its value the better is the strategy.
Illustration with Hedge Fund Strategies
In the following, we use: The Hedge Fund Research Indices 8 (HFRI) as proxies for various 
hedge funds strategies; the S&P 500 and the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index to 
model investments in equity and bonds9 over the 1990 to 2016 time period. The purpose of 
this section is to show the added-value of the alternative risk measures in the context of a 
portfolio construction process using various hedge-fund strategies.

The Sharpe Ratio and Ulcer Performance Index in T able 3 exhibit the weakness - indeed, the 
danger — of not properly acknowledging the “extreme” risk of an investment.
Relative Value strategies present the best risk adjusted metrics through Sharpe Ratio 
and Ulcer Performance Index. However, for the Pitfall Indicator they fall to 7th place with 
extreme drawdowns reaching 3.17 times their level of volatility. This could prove harmful 
to an investor in the context of a classic risk parity allocation as the investor would have 
allocated more capital towards those strategies looking solely at volatility. These strategies 
display steady returns but their actual drawdowns can be sharper than expected. Investors 
choosing to allocate to Relative Value strategies run the risk of having their long-term steady 
performance gains wiped out by a rare and deep drawdown.
While strategies such as Global Macro and Systematic Diversifi  ed seem less appealing when 
considering their Sharpe Ratio (5th and 7th place respectively), they are amongst the top 
three strategies in terms of Ulcer Performance Index. They also outclass all other strategies 
when using the Pitfall Indicator. While providing less steady returns, Systematic Diversifi  ed 
and Global Marco Strategies are less likely to incur heavy drawdowns compared to their level 
of volatility. These strategies have less hidden risk.

Comparing classic and alternative risk metrics on hedge-fund strategies exacerbates the 
necessity of managing both average and extreme risk during the allocation process. Using 
only the Sharpe Ratio (hence considering volatility as the only measure of risk) can lead 
to allocating more capital towards strategies with a higher probability of blow-up. This risk 
can be mitigated through the consideration of both the Ulcer Index and the Pitfall Indicator 
through the Serenity Ratio.
An Alternative Portfolio Theory
The Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) developed by Markowitz (1952) uses volatility as the 
sole risk metric. The allocation process proposed by Markowitz is driven by attaining the 
maximum Sharpe Ratio on the Portfolio.
We propose to adapt MPT by maximizing the Serenity Ratio. In the classic Risk-Return 
space, we replace Volatility with our Penalized Risk Metric.
Figure 5 displays the values of Returns and Penalized Risk for every strategy. The lines 
drawn on the graph represent indifference lines for the investor as the value of the Serenity 
Ratio stays constant over each line. A rational investor always prefers strategies in the upper 
left quadrant to strategies in the bottom right quadrant, as they present a higher measure 
of Serenity. Investors would therefore be better off investing in Systematic Diversified or 
Global Macro hedge funds if they wish to maximize their performance relative the risk of 
drawdowns looking at Ulcer and Pitfall.
The proximity between Sharpe and Serenity will be further developed in our second white 
paper by introducing the definition of an efficient frontier analogous to the theory developed 
by Markowitz (1952) and previously studied in Harris and Mazibas (2011), Allen et al. (2015) 
and Goldberg and Mahmoud (2015).

Conclusion
Investors should be aware of the incomplete nature of using classic risk metrics such 
as volatility, Sharpe Ratio, VaR, and CVaR as inputs into investment decisions. All these 
measures share the same flaw: Considering time-independence of returns (and leaving 
out any potential auto-correlation). Thus, we believe the use of Ulcer and Pitfall in addition 
to these widely used risk measures is advised if an investor wishes to have a better 
understanding of both known and hidden risks of a strategy. Indeed, when comparing many 
hedge fund strategies using only classic risk measures, we find that some strategies seem 
very appealing when investors only use volatility as a risk measure, therefore maximizing the 
Sharpe Ratio. However, the perception of global risk of these strategies is better depicted 
by including the risk of drawdowns, through Ulcer and especially, through Pitfall. Replacing 
the classic Markowitz representation (Mean-Variance) with both the Ulcer and the Pitfall 
(Mean-Penalized Risk) introduces a new and interesting manner of sorting strategies. The 
use of these alternative risk metrics reduces the risk of an investment blow-up by preventing 
misallocation to riskier strategies. This Alternative Portfolio Theory will be further developed 
in a second white paper, taking into account the correlation of drawdowns and defining an 
alternative efficient frontier.

Annex 1 – Coherent Risk Measure
A coherent risk measure ρ as defined by Artzner & al. (1999) must respect the following 
properties:
(1) Normalized
ρ(0)=0
The risk of holding no assets is zero.
(2) Monotonicity
If X1 and X2 are two portfolios and X1 ≤ X2 almost surely, then ρ(X1) ≥ ρ(X2).
The risk of a better portfolio is always lower.
(3) Positive Homogeneity
If λ > 0 then ρ(λX) = λρ(X)
Which means that if you double your portfolio you double your risk.
(4) Insensitivity to a constant shift
If a is a constant, ρ(X + a) = ρ(X)
(5) Sub-additivity
If X1 and X2 are two portfolios
ρ(X1 + X2) < ρ(X1) + ρ(X2) 
The risk of two portfolios together cannot be worse than adding the risks of each portfolio. 
This is the concept of diversification.
(6) Convexity 
The notion of sub-additivity and positive homogeneity can be replaced by the notion of convexity: 
Ulcer Index
(1), (2), (3), (4) are a direct consequence of the definition.
(6) Convexity: even though the Ulcer Index is defined as a norm in the mathematical sense  
and therefore is convex we will show it here.

  [0,1]  ρ(λX1 + (1 – λ) X2) <  λρ(X1) + (1 – λ)ρ(X2 )

Using (3), we only have to show that the Euclidean norm is convex. Therefore, we have to  
prove that its unit ball is convex.
We have: 
Therefore                                    which means       is convex and the norm is also convex.
Thus the Ulcer Index is a convex risk measure.

Annex 3 – Autocorrelation of Hedge Fund Indexes
By definition, auto-correlation is defined as the correlation between the values of the same 
process at different times. We have tested autocorrelation of lag 1 for all the indexes of annex 
2, in order to detect indexes where returns are somewhat linked to previous returns. Indeed, 
one can see that if an asset exhibits high autocorrelation, it means that when negative returns 
occur, they persist over time and cause drawdowns. Therefore, for strategies with high 
autocorrelation, it is not abnormal to find deep drawdowns and therefore high pitfall indexes.
The table below presents the AR(1) (Lag 1 Auto regressive coefficient) based on monthly 
data from 1990 to 2016 and their statistical significance according to the Ljung-Box test (* 
represent statistical significance at the 5% level).

Figure 6: Lag 1 Autocorrelation for the 1990-2016 period  
(blue color represents significance at the 5% confidence level)
We can see that many hedge-fund strategies exhibit statistically significant autocorrelation 
through the 1990-2016 period. Fixed-Income convertible arbitrage and Multi-strategy hedge 
funds even exhibit coefficient above 0.5 showing strong autocorrelation of returns. As a 
conclusion, it is statistically sound to find that the returns of some strategies tend to persist 
over time creating period of inevitable drawdowns.
